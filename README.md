# The Product-Focused Engineer

The Product-Focused Engineer is a weekly podcast series hosted by Mason Meyer, focused on the intersection of engineering and product thinking — where technical craft meets real user impact.

You can listen every Thursday at 2pm ET / 11am PT on your favorite podcast platform or watch full episodes on YouTube (coming soon).

This series is designed to help engineers, PMs, tech leads, and builders of all kinds sharpen their understanding of how great software gets built — not just by writing code, but by solving real problems. Whether you’re a junior developer or an engineering leader, you’ll get insights on how to think more like a product owner while staying grounded in technical excellence.
